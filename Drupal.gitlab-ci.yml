# This template will create a pipeline for linting and deploying a Drupal
# repository change to all environments included as stages in the pipeline.
#
# How to use:
# Include this template in your pipeline, and select the stages from this template you
# want to include (based on which environments are appropriate). For each of those
# environments, override the job and set the correct SERVER to deploy to for that
# environment and any other variables you need to change for that environment (for example
# if you have different SSH keys used). See the Drupal.gitlab-ci.example.yml file included
# in this repository for an example pipeline using this template.
#
# Required Variables:
#  * REPO_PATH: The path to the repository to update on the SERVER
#  * USER: The user to connect to the SERVER as
#  * ENCODED_PRIVATE_KEY: A base64 encoded private key used to connect to SERVER. Can be
#                         generated from an existing private key using something similar to:
#                         `base64 id_ed25519 -w0` then storing it in a CI/CD variable
#                         (preferably masked and protected), NEVER commit to your repository!
#  * SERVER: The server name you want to connect to (example: myserver.edu)
