# CI/CD Templates

This repository contains templates for use in GitLab CI/CD pipelines.
Each template has a corresponding `.example` file with it that shows how
you could include it in your own repository's main `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

For more instructions on methods to include templates see
[Gitlab's official documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/includes.html).

** For Non- MSU Library Users **  
These templates are currently all using GitLab runners specific to the MSU Libraries,
so if you want to use them, you will need to override the `tag` in them.
